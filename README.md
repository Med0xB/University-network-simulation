# University-network-simulation
This is a Campus LAN network design connecting three buildings using VLAN segmentation, inter-VLAN routing, DHCP, ACLs, and SSH access.

üè¢ Campus Structure

Three departments/buildings are connected via a core switch:

Administration (VLAN 10)

Guest Hall Wi-Fi Zone (VLAN 20)

Computer Science Department (VLAN 30)

Information Technology Department (VLAN 40)


üõ† Technologies Used

Cisco Packet Tracer for simulation

VLANs for segmentation

802.1Q Trunking to carry multiple VLANs

Inter-VLAN Routing via a router (Router-on-a-Stick model)

DHCP server for dynamic IP assignment (VLAN 20)

SSH access enabled on router for secure management

ACLs to restrict inter-VLAN access and enhance security


üîê Security Logic (ACLs)

VLAN 10 (Admin) is protected: No other VLAN can reach it

VLAN 20 (Guest) is isolated: Cannot access any other VLAN

VLAN 10 retains access to all VLANs for management purposes

SSH access is restricted and secured with credentials



‚úÖ Outcomes

Efficient segmentation for organization and control

Secure inter-VLAN communication with restricted access

Scalability for future departments and services

Realistic simulation of a professional enterprise network
